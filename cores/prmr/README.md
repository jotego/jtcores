Yes, you always wanted to have an arcade board at home. First you couldn't get it because your parents somehow did not understand you. Then you grow up and your wife doesn't understand you either. Don't worry, JT cores are here to the rescue.

I hope you will have as much fun with this project as I had while working on it!

# Supported Systems

This FPGA core is compatible with the following arcade PCBs:

- Premier Soccer

This core does not fit in devices with small internal RAMs, such as MiST and SiDi.

# Game Configuration

This game has a small EEPROM to save the configuration. Access to the configuration by pressing F2 on your keyboard or pressing button 1 and coin in the Analogue Pocket. Follow the game menu to alter the configuration from that point on.
