# Macro Definition

Macros are expected in the file *cores/corename/cfg/macros.def*. From there, other files can be included. The *macros.def* file accepts target-specific macros. Check for examples in JT cores, such as [kicker](https://github.com/jotego/jtkicker).

Macros can also be defined when invoking *jtcore* or *jtframe* command-line tools.

Macros in *macros.def* can have different values for a given target platform, using the following syntax:

```
# defines FOO as 4
FOO=4
[sidi]
# but in the sidi platform, it will become 6
FOO=6
[mist*]
# and in mist/mister platforms, it will be 7
FOO=7
```

The glob matching pattern (using * and ? as in the command line) is supported for target platform name comparisons.

# System Name

There are two macros that define the core name the FPGA will use when communicating with the rest of the target platform. This is the name that MiST(er) display in the side of the OSD menu under some circumstances. It is also the name used for compilation files and the RBF file name. If undefined, the core folder name will be used. CORENAME is a way of using a different name for the core folder and the core itself.

The core's game module that connects to the target top module is set by GAMETOP. If undefined, it will default to $CORENAME_game (or $CORENAME_game_sdram when cfg/mem.yaml exists). $CORENAME is used in lower case for the GAMETOP.

A macro for the core folder name in capitals is always defined and can be used in `ifdef` statements when a file is common to several cores.

Macro         |  Usage                  | Default Value
--------------|-------------------------|------------------
CORENAME      | Core name               | Core's folder name
GAMETOP       | Core's game module name | $CORENAME_game(_sdram)
