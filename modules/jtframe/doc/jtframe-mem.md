# Parses the core's YAML file to generate RTL files.

The YAML file name must be mem.yaml and be stored in cores/corename/cfg
The output files are stored in cores/corename/target where target is
one of the names in the $JTFRAME/target folder (mist, mister, etc.).

## mem.yaml Syntax
```
# Include other .yaml files
include:
    - game: cop
    - file: ../../cop/cfg/mem.yaml
# Parameters to be used in the sdram section
params: [ {name:vSCR_OFFSET, value: "32'h10000"}, ... ]
# Map SDRAM addresses during download by
# passing additional ports to the game module
download:
    pre_addr: false   # modify the address value going into the downloader
    post_addr: false  # modify the address value going into the SDRAM
    post_data: false  # modify the data byte going into the SDRAM
    noswab: false     # Reverse all bytes, avoid using it and modify the MRA instead
# Connect addtional output ports from the game module
ports:
    - { name: foo_data, msb: 15, lsb: 0, input:true }
    - { name: foo_cs }
