# Default module definitions
# vpp is the normalized amplitude for a 5V supply
# i.e. YM3014 outputs from 1/4*VDD to 3/4*VDD, so its vpp is 0.5
#     MSM5205 outputs goes from 0 to 5V, so its vpp is 1.0

# jt49: 10 kOhm load resistor -> 2.25V -> vpp = 0.45
# jt49:  1 kOhm load resistor -> 0.92V -> vpp = 0.18
# using 1 kOhm for vpp, as it is more typical
# AY-3-8910 could have different VPP than YM2149
# each channel is vpp: 0.2 but as jt49 merges the channel without
# saturation, it adds extra bits that will result in less gain in the
# jtframe mixer. For now, setting vpp to 0.6 (0.2*3 channels). Real
# circuit probably has a compressed output, and different profile depending
# on whether the channels are joined or not and the load resistor side.
# it must be measured at some point
