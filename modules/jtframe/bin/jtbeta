JTBETA Beta release preparation. (c) Jose Tejada 2021, @topapate

    jtbeta core master_branch [options for jtupdate]
    JTUTIL must point to the JTUTIL repository

    Beta preparation:

    -A "week" branch must exist
    -The "week" branch will be compared to the master branch in the arguments.
     They must be equal to proceed. The work is done in the master branch.
    -If a patrons/msg file exist, it must have been modified since the
     last beta tag
    -The builds.log file is reset off git
    -The jtupdate script is run with the added options:
        * --all
        * --seed
        * --beta
    -If all compilations are succesful:
        * commit the builds.log
        * tag the commit as "beta_core_month_day"

    The output files will be available in the $JTROOT/releases folder

    See also: cpmra2bin to copy the MRA files from a folder to JTBIN in the
    right way
