# JTFRAME target for Terasic DE10lite board

## Target information

This target is based on [DeMiSTify](https://github.com/robinsonb5/DeMiSTify) firmware by Alastair M. Robinson. DeMiSTify is code to support porting MiST cores to other boards. 

There is no available gerbers for a retro board with sdcard, ps2 and audio jack for this board yet.  Look at top files and qsf for figuring out the pinout.

There are two top target files available:

* jtframe_de10lite_top.vhd @robinsonb5 hardware top file
* jtframe_de10lite_top.vhd_dar  @darfpga hardware top file  (rename to jtframe_de10lite_top.vhd)
